## Company Name: NegaMart 

## 1.	Company background

The company background is a neighbourhood grocery store that serves families and residents living nearby. The store is not that big, but during peak hours it gets busy, usually during after work hours 6-7pm and weekends.

•	The staffs have to handle many different tasks everyday such as:
•	Restocking shelves and organising products
•	Checking expiry dates
•	Assisting customers
•	Operating the cashier
•	Keeping the store clean
•	Updating inventory 

Because there are many tasks to manage at once, the store environment can get fast paced especially during peak hours

## 2.	Main problem

The main problem the store faces is that new staff struggle to keep up during their first few weeks as many of them have little experience working in retail, so they take longer to get used to basic tasks like cashiering and restocking. This causes slow workflow, mistakes, and the constant need for supervision from senior staffs which can be a waste of manpower.

## 3.	Why does this problem matter?

This training issues leads to many challenges for the store such as:
-	Slower checkouts and longer queues
-	Shelves becoming messy or arranged wrongly
-	Expired products not removed
-	Lower customer satisfaction
-	More workload for existing staff because they need to guide the new hires
-	Reduced overall productivity
As a result, the store cannot operate smoothly, especially during rush hours.
## 4.	More Training Cost 
Training new hires takes up time and manpower. Senior staffs have to step away from their own tasks to explain routine, correct mistakes, and monitor new employees to prevent them from doing something wrong. Since the grocery store operates on tight budget, they need a low-cost, consistent, and repeatable training method that helps staff learn faster independently without relying on senior staff heavily.

## 5.	Target Users
The target users for this training are:
-	Newly hired grocery store staff
-	Employees with little or no retail experience
-	Anyone who needs extra practice before doing tasks individually

## Section 3: Game Plan 
Game overview
The purpose of this game is to help train the players to become ready to handle any situation expected of a person that’s working at a grocery store. The game is to help them practice their skills digitally so that they can build confidence, learn to work under pressure and for them to build that muscle memory capable of responding to any situation and capable of doing such repetitive tasks. The game uses things like timers and a points system to recreate the feel of a real work environment. This allows them to train new staff through a game instead of training them on the job.
There will be 4 levels to the game each representing a main part of working in a grocery store.
•	Level 1: Cashier 
Trains speed and accuracy in item scanning, putting items in the bag and giving change.

•	Level 2: Shelf Stocking
Trains organisational ability and accuracy and speed of stocking items in the correct place.

•	Level 3: Cleaning
Trains the ability to swiftly respond to any spillage or accident and immediately clean it up.

•	Level 4: Customer Service
Trains customer service and communication skills
Together these 4 levels creates a training simulator that trains new employees on the daily responsibilities of a grocery store employee in a fast efficient and cheap method.





## LEVEL 1: CASHIER
User Empathy
New cashiers usually struggle with scanning items quickly and handling money correctly. Many also get nervous when the queue gets long and the customers are watching their every move. So this level 1 make this process less scary allowing them to practice without real customers judging them and helping them build confidence and some sort of familiarity to the task.
 
Workflow
1. Items appear on conveyor belt
2. Player scans each item
Player will drag each item 1 by 1 onto the scanner. A sound to confirm                                                                                    the item has been scanned
3. Player bags the scanned items
After scan confirm drag it into the shopping bag
3. Customer pays
A message to show how much the customer paid
4. Give change 
Looking at the total and change amount on the POS system screen, player will select correct notes and/or coins for change. There will be a feedback to show whether the change selected is correct or not.
6. End of level
Game ends when all items are scanned, all items are in the bag and correct change is given. When all these conditions are met the player passes. The player loses if timer runs out and conditions are not met and when the incorrect amount of change is given more than 2 times.

## LEVEL 2: SHELVES STOCKING
User empathy
New staff often misplace items and are slow to restock because there is so many products and categories that it is hard to find the correct place fast and to stock the items with speed. They also get nervous when the customers are standing there wating for them to restock faster so they can buy what they need. Level 2 helps to simplify the process with clear labels and stocking a few items at a time. This helps reduce the confusion and helps staff learn where to place which items in a calm environment. Level 2 will be modelled after the real stores.
 

Workflow
Player sees shelves empty and with some items in the wrong place. And more items by the sides of the shelves.
1. Place items in correct area
Players will drag each item 1 by 1 into the correct shelf with the correct labels. If placed correctly there will be tick sound if placed wrongly the gives wrong sound. The goal is to continue until a certain number of items are placed correctly for example 10 items to be placed for the level to be cleared.
2. End of game
Player wins if all items are placed correctly within time limit. Players loses if timer runs out before placing all items correctly. This trains speed and accuracy.

## LEVEL 3: CLEANING
User empathy
When multiple spills happen at once new staff have delayed responses due to not being able to spot hazards early on and are rushing to quickly clean them up before customer complaints or accidents happen. Level 3 is designed with only one goal which is to clean anything and everything. This helps the staff get used to moving arounds the store and cleaning anything they spot. The repetitive nature of the game helps them get accustomed to such sudden situations and allows them to practice without any real consequences.
 
Workflow
Players see a grocery store aisle will spills all over the floor
1. Player cleans the spills
Player uses arrow keys to move the mop sprite. When the mop sprite touches the spill, it disappears
2. More spills appear 
After all the spills are cleaned more appear to clean until the level goal of a certain amount is reached for example 12 spills must be cleaned to clear the level
3. End of game
Player wins if goal of 12 spills is cleared. Player loses if timer runs out before all spills are cleared.

## LEVEL 4: CUSTOMER SERVICE
User empathy:
New staff often don’t know what to say or how to respond whenever a customer asks a question or complains or needs help. This can cause mistakes and customer complaints. So level 4 is designed to help train new staff way of thinking and train their communication skills without any real consequences. A customer asks a question and there is options with different replies, most wrong answers some correct this helps the employees understand and learn how to properly respond to any situation or questions preparing them for real conversations.
 
Workflow
1. Customer appears and a speech bubble appears with a question. For example they ask, “where is the milk?”
2. Player choses an option
A few options appear. Some correct, some wrong, some partially correct.
3. Reply/Feedback
If correct option was picked customer reply positively like for example “thank you!” 
If wrong option was picked customer reply negatively like for example “How rude! Let me speak to your manager”
4. More customers/scenarios 
Multiple and diverse scenarios and types of customers to properly train staff to handle any situation.
5. End of Game
The level ends when a set number of scenarios are done for example 5 scenarios
Player wins if most scenarios are handled correctly. Player loses if most handled wrongly.
