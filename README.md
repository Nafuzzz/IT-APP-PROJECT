# IT-APP-PROJECT
Repo for our scratch game 
Project Brief – “Grocery Pro Training Game”
Company Overview

Company Name: FreshMart Supermarket
Industry: Retail – Grocery and Supermarket
Size: Medium-sized supermarket with around 40 employees and two outlets in Singapore.
Location: Head office and main branch located in Tampines, Singapore.

Company Context

FreshMart is a neighbourhood supermarket that serves hundreds of customers daily. The company prides itself on providing fast, friendly, and clean service. However, the manager has noticed that new employees often struggle during their first few weeks on the job. Mistakes at the cashier, empty shelves, unclean aisles, and poor customer communication affect customer satisfaction and slow down daily operations.

Problem Statement

FreshMart faces operational issues due to inconsistent staff performance, especially among new hires who are still learning their roles. Current training relies only on observation and short briefings, which do not effectively prepare staff for real customer situations. The company needs an interactive, engaging, and low-cost way to train employees in basic supermarket duties before they start working on the floor.

Game Concept

🏪 Game Concept: “Grocery Pro Training Game”

Company: FreshMart Supermarket
Issue: New staff make mistakes during busy hours — wrong billing, empty shelves, dirty floors, and poor customer interaction.
Goal: Train employees through four short game levels that each focus on one role.

🎮 Part 1 — Cashiering (Member 1)

Gameplay:

Customers come to the counter with 2–3 items.

Player scans items (clicks each one), system shows total.

Player must collect the right payment amount (drag coins/notes to register).

Wrong total → “customer unhappy” sound or message.


Uses simple click, drag, and variable for total score.

🎮 Part 2 — Restocking Shelves (Member 2)

Gameplay:

Empty shelf sprites flash or turn red.

Player drags correct item (milk, bread, fruit) from storeroom to shelf.

Correct shelf = +1 point; wrong = -1.

Timer adds pressure (simulate busy restocking).


Uses drag-and-drop, broadcast messages, and backdrop changes.

🎮 Part 3 — Cleaning / Mopping (Member 3)

Gameplay:

Random dirty spots appear on the floor.

Player moves mop sprite with arrow keys to clean them before timer ends.

Each cleaned spot adds points.


Basic movement and collision detection — easy in Scratch.

🎮 Part 4 — Customer Service (Member 4)

Gameplay:

Customers approach and ask a question (“Where’s the bread?” or “Can I return this?”).

Player clicks one of 3 answer buttons.

Correct answer → happy customer; wrong → loses points.


Uses simple dialogue boxes and button clicks with broadcast messages.

🧩 Integration (Team)

After each mini-game:

Add a “score summary” screen showing player performance.

After all 4 levels → show “Training Complete!” message and total score.

Use broadcast messages to move from one stage to the next.

Expected Outcome

The game provides a fun, hands-on way for new employees to practice their responsibilities. It improves understanding of supermarket operations and helps FreshMart reduce beginner mistakes, leading to smoother service and happier customers.
